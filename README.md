# Pixel-Phraser

This project uses deep learning techniques to generate detailed descriptions of images using the LSTM algorithm. The goal is to provide an accurate and comprehensive description of a given image. The web application is designed using Flask, HTML, and CSS.



## Description
The Pixel-Phraser leverages the power of deep learning, specifically the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, to generate detailed descriptions of images. This web application, built using Flask, allows users to upload an image and receive a descriptive textual output.
